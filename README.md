## Personal website to be hosted on ivorpad.com

This website is an experimental site build from the ground up with React.js, Redux (+Thunk), Styled Components, React Router 4, redux-forms, ExpressJS and TailwindCSS. 

I decided against Gatsby.js because even though is an amazing tool to build static sites, I wanted to practice and create the site from scratch.
